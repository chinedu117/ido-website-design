# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview
The MedChain IDO website aims to create a decentralized platform that enables users to participate in the Initial DEX Offering (IDO) of MedChain tokens on the Sepolia testnet. The platform will provide a seamless interface for users to connect their wallets and interact with the deployed smart contracts.

## Goals
- Enable secure wallet connection functionality using Web3 providers
- Implement interaction with MedChain IDO smart contracts on Sepolia testnet
- Create a user-friendly interface for token purchase and management
- Provide real-time feedback and transaction status updates

## Specifications

### Frontend Components
- **WalletConnection**: Component responsible for managing wallet connections and user authentication
  - Support for MetaMask and other Web3 wallets
  - Display of connected wallet address
  - Network validation to ensure Sepolia connection
  
- **IDOInterface**: Main component for IDO participation
  - Token purchase functionality
  - Display of token allocation and prices
  - Transaction status indicators
  
- **DashboardSection**: User dashboard showing:
  - Token balance
  - Purchase history
  - Vesting schedule (if applicable)

### Smart Contract Integration
- Utilize the ABI from `contract/abi-MedChainIDO.json` for smart contract interactions
- Implement necessary contract functions:
  - Purchase tokens
  - Check allocation
  - View vesting schedule
  - Withdraw tokens (if applicable)

### Environment Variables
Required environment variables for the application:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_IDO_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<medchain_ido_contract_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<medchain_token_address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK_ID=11155111 # Sepolia network ID
```

### Implementation Requirements

1. **Wallet Connection**
   - Implement wallet connect button in the navigation
   - Add network validation for Sepolia
   - Handle wallet connection states (connected, disconnected, wrong network)

2. **Smart Contract Integration**
   - Initialize Web3 provider
   - Create contract instances using ABIs
   - Implement error handling for failed transactions
   - Add gas estimation for transactions

3. **User Interface Updates**
   - Show loading states during transactions
   - Display transaction success/failure messages
   - Update token balances after successful purchases
   - Show connected wallet status

4. **Error Handling**
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Insufficient funds
   - Transaction failures
   - Smart contract errors

### Testing Requirements
1. **Wallet Integration Testing**
   - Test wallet connection/disconnection
   - Verify network switching functionality
   - Validate address display

2. **Transaction Testing**
   - Test token purchase flow
   - Verify transaction confirmation
   - Check balance updates
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Smart Contract Integration Testing**
   - Verify contract function calls
   - Test event listeners
   - Validate response handling

## Success Metrics
- Successful wallet connections
- Completed transactions
- User feedback and interaction metrics
- Error rate monitoring

## Future Considerations
- Support for additional wallet providers
- Enhanced transaction history
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multiple network support

## Security Considerations
- Implement secure wallet connection practices
- Validate all transaction parameters
- Protect against common Web3 vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits of smart contract interactions

This PRD serves as a guide for implementing the wallet connection and smart contract integration features for the MedChain IDO website on the Sepolia testnet. The implementation should follow best practices for Web3 development and ensure a secure and user-friendly experience.
